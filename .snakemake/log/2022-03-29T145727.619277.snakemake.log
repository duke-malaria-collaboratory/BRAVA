Building DAG of jobs...
The code used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-code-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-code-changes)'.
The input used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-input-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-input-changes)'.
The params used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-params-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-params-changes)'.

Removing output files of failed job censor_haplotypes since they might be corrupted:
out/haplotype_output/AMA_snps_between_haps_within_samples.fasta, out/haplotype_output/AMA_uniqueSeqs.fasta, out/haplotype_output/AMA_aligned_seqs.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
