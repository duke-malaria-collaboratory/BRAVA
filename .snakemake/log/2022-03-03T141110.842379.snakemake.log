Building DAG of jobs...
The code used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-code-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-code-changes)'.
The input used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-input-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-input-changes)'.
The params used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-params-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-params-changes)'.

ImproperOutputException in line 38 of /gpfs/fs1/home/kh455/snakemake-tutorial/Snakefile:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule organize_folders:
out/fastq/AMA/all_samples
Removing output files of failed job organize_folders since they might be corrupted:
out/fastq/AMA/all_samples
Skipped removing non-empty directory out/fastq/AMA/all_samples
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
