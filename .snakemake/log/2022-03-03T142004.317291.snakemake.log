Building DAG of jobs...
The code used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-code-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-code-changes)'.
The input used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-input-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-input-changes)'.
The params used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-params-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-params-changes)'.

ImproperOutputException in line 21 of /gpfs/fs1/home/kh455/snakemake-tutorial/Snakefile:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule clean_sequencing_reads:
out/fastq/AMA/1
Removing output files of failed job clean_sequencing_reads since they might be corrupted:
out/fastq/AMA/1, out/fastq/AMA/2
Skipped removing non-empty directory out/fastq/AMA/1
