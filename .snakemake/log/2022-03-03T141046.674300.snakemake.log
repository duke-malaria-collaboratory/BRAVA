Building DAG of jobs...
The code used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-code-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-code-changes)'.
The input used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-input-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-input-changes)'.
The params used to generate one or several output files has changed:
    To inspect which output files have changes, run 'snakemake --list-params-changes'.
    To trigger a re-run, use 'snakemake -R $(snakemake --list-params-changes)'.
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Error in rule organize_folders:
    jobid: 0
    output: out/fastq/AMA/all_samples
    shell:
        mkdir out/fastq/AMA/all_samples && cp out/fastq/AMA/1/*.fastq.gz out/fastq/AMA/all_samples && cp out/fastq/AMA/2/*.fastq.gz out/fastq/AMA/all_samples && mkdir out/haplotype_output
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job organize_folders since they might be corrupted:
out/fastq/AMA/all_samples
Skipped removing non-empty directory out/fastq/AMA/all_samples
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
